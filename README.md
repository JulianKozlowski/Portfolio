## About me
Hi everyone!
I love mountains, gym, playing games and reading books.

I'd love to switch business to broadly speaking - IT and software testing in particular due to new technologies, new challenges and modern approach to the employee and work organization witch is the most important thing to me.

Currently I work as a data analyst in the Polish special forces. Discipline, detail and analytical mind are my everyday life.
Moreover, several years in the army thought me comradeship, teamwork, openness, and peace of mind.
