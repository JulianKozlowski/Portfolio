## About me
Hi everyone!
I love sports, hiking, shooting, psychology, literature and computer games.

I'd love to switch my career to the field of IT and software testing in particular, due to the new technologies, modern approache to employee and work organization which are most important to me.

Currently, I work as a data analyst in the Polish Army. Discipline, attention to detail, and an analytical mindset are a part of my everyday life. Moreover, several years in the army taught me about comradeship, teamwork, openness, and peace of mind.
